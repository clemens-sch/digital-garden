>series of guidelines for a DB

to organize & structure a DB 
to reduce redundancy and dependency issues, ensuring efficient storage, minimizing data anomalies

__Several levels of normalization:__

**1. 0th Normal Form (0NF):**
- Raw data, no structure
- Values in attributes are atomic

**2. 1st Normal Form (1NF):**
- Elimination of repeated groups
- Unique key identification

**3. 2nd Normal Form (2NF):**
- Elimination of partial key dependencies
- All non-key attributes fully functionally dependent on the entire key

**4. 3rd Normal Form (3NF):**
- Elimination of transitive dependencies
- No non-key attribute transitively dependent on a key

**Dependencies between 0th, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Normal Forms:**
- 1NF eliminates redundancy of repeated value groups.
- 2NF eliminates partial key dependencies within the table.
- 3NF eliminates transitive dependencies between non-key attributes.

**Transition from 0th to 1st to 2nd to 3rd Normal Form:**
- **0NF to 1NF:** Organize data into rows and columns, ensuring each attribute contains atomic values, eliminating repeating groups.
- **1NF to 2NF:** Remove partial key dependencies by ensuring non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key.
- **2NF to 3NF:** Eliminate transitive dependencies, ensuring no non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute through a key.

Basic Table

---
### # 1st Normal Form

- all rows must be unique (no duplicate rows)
- every cell - only a single value (no list)
- each value - not divisible (not split down further)

---
### # 2nd Normal Form
- MUST BE IN 1st FORM
- all dependencies that don't depend on primary key - should get an own table

---
### # 3rd Normal Form
- MUST BE IN 1st & 2nd FORM
- no transitive dependency
	- all fields must be determinable by the primary/compoite key - not by other keys

### # Example - 1st Form

![[Pasted image 20231122172945.png]]

Problem 1 - All rows must be <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">uniquely identifiable</mark>
- they are not uniquely identifiable
![[Pasted image 20231122173119.png]]

solution: Add an ID 
- Now it is no longer identical - different IDs
![[Pasted image 20231122173252.png]]

Problem 2 - they have <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">multiple values</mark>

![[Pasted image 20231122173507.png]]

solution: seperate table
- Now we have a seperate table with order items
![[Pasted image 20231122173710.png]]

Problem 3 - all data must be <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">atomic (non-divisible)</mark>

### # Example - 2nd Form

![[Pasted image 20231122175740.png]]

Problem 1 - <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">no partial dependency</mark>
- Course Fee does not depend on Student ID

solution:

### # Example - 3rd Form

![[Pasted image 20231122180308.png]]

Problem 1 - <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">no transitive dependency</mark>
- Winner's DOB is dependend on the winner
