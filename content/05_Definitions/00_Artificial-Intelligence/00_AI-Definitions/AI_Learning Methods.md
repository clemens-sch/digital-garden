## # How an AI Learns

There are several forms an AI can learn 

| method                 | explanation                                                                                                               | example               |     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --- |
| Supervised Learning    | Learning with labeled data; <br>predicting outcomes based on known examples (e.g., image classification, spam detection). | image classification  |     |
| Unsupervised Learning  | Learning without labeled data; <br>finding patterns and structure in data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).   | recommendation System |     |
| Reinforcement Learning | Learning through feedback                                                                                                 | Roboter               |     |
| Generative Ai          | Learning through statistics - finds data                                                                                  | ChatGPT               |     |

## # Supervised-Learning

while creating this ML model - there is a supervision **training & feedback**

several phases
- training phase - feed the ml-system with data
- model is trained with data
- learning takes place through `epochs` (learns a bit --> feedback --> improves for next time)

### # Example

Dad teaches child how to swim in pool. The child learns to swim gradually after many sessions based on regular feedback from his dad.

---
## # Unsupervised-Learning

no supervision for this ML model

facts
- no trainings 
- model is fed with data - has to learn & find patterns/realtionships by itself

### # Example

There is no dad to supervise here. The child simply jumps into the pool and has to learn swimming on its own.

## # Supervised- vs Unsupervised- Learning

### Supervised model

- data has output label
- learns mapping between input & output
	- based on feedback

### Unsupervised Training

- data has no output label
- model learns pattern/relationship without any feedback

## # Sub-Categories

#### Supervised Learning
2 main subcategories
- Regression
- Classification

#### Unsupervised Learning
3 main subcategories

- Clustering
