| AI        | Artificial Intelligence | imitate human actions with machines - to solve problems                                                     |
| ML        | Machine Learning        | learn & improve without actions of humans - the more data the algorithm gets, the more the ML system learns |
| DL        | Deep Learning           | evolvement of ML - uses neural networks (work like human brain)                                             |
