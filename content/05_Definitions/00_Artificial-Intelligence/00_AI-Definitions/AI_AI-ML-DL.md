| AI        | Artificial Intelligence | imitate human actions with machines - to solve problems                                             |                                             |
| ML        | Machine Learning        | looks for predictions based on information (data) we have; the more data it has = better prediction | Supervised learning; Unsupervised learning; |
| DL        | Deep Learning           | evolvement of ML - Neural Networks (works like human brain);                                        |                                             |
