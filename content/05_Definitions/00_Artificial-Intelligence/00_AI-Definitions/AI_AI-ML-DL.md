| AI        | Artificial Intelligence | imitate human actions with machines - to solve problems                                             |
| ML        | Machine Learning        | looks for predictions based on information (data) we have; the more data it has = better prediction |
| DL        | Deep Learning           | uses neural networks (works like human brain) - "deep" = multiple layers of neural networks;        |
