## # What is NumPy?

Important Python Library for Data Science, Machine Learning (working with arrays).

One of most useful libraries in Python
- very fast (if compared to Lists)
---
### # Basics

The library itself - mainly used to work with arrays.

Array = table of elements (e.g. numbers) - organized in a specific way.
- All these elements: same type, are identified using non-negative integers.

In NumPy, arrays can have multiple dimensions - called `axes`.
e.g. coordinates of a point in <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">3D</mark> space is represented as <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">[1, 2, 1]</mark> - it forms array with one `axis`. This `axis` has a length of 3 (consists of 3 elements).

NumPy's array class is called "ndarray" - numpy.array != array.array
