## # What is MongoDB ?

MongoDB is an open-source, NoSQL database that provides high performance, high availability & easy scalability.
It is a document-oriented database.

---
## # Some Basics

### # Object-Oriented

This means, that the database stores data in JSON-like documents.
These documents can vary in structure.

---
### # NoSQL

MongoDB is classified as NoSQL database. 
This means, that it does not use the traditional rows & columns of relational databases.
- Instead, it uses collections and documents

These databases store data in flexible, schema-less formats: JSON, BSON documents.
Even though, it is possible to write a schema-definition for a MongoDB database.

## # MQL

MongoDB has its own query language, similar to SQL
The MongoDB Query Language supports a wide range of queries, including CRUD operations, aggregation, geospatial queries.
