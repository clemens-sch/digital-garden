## # Introduction

Trees are <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">data structures</mark> commonly used in computer science and databases
to <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">efficiently store and manage large sets of data</mark>, particularly in scenarios where data needs to be inserted, deleted, or searched quickly.

## # Tree Structures

Here are some sample Tree Structures & how to use them.

### # B-Tree

`Balanced-Tree`

B-tree is a special type of self-balancing search tree in which each node can contain more than one key and can have more than two children. It is a generalized form of theÂ [binary search tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/binary-search-tree).

### # B+Tree

`Balanced-Plus-Tree`

A B+ Tree is an advanced form of a self-balancing tree in which all the values are present in the leaf level.

- data gets only saved in leafs

### # R-Tree

`Rectangle-Tree`

R-Tree is used for spatial indexing, commonly employed in spatial databases and geographic information systems (GIS) - by rectangles.

#### # How the index works

An index in an R-Tree works like a smart map. It divides the space into boxes, each holding info about objects in that area - from one quadrant to the next. 
When you look for something in a specific zone, you check the tree and quickly find the relevant details.
